F1 dataset with weather data, car telemetrics, lap telemetrics

Heatmap of overtaking zones/breaking zones

What is optimal layout for overtaking
	- compare different track layouts to solve
	example: Overtaking into a hairpin is popular on tack 1 but not on track 2. Why?

which corners are most dangerous
	example: car goes into corner 2, but stops transmitting further data. Then we know something happend in corner 2

Which drivers are best in different weather conditions

What makes a car good, corner speed vs top speed
	example: we find corner speed by first detecting corners and then we look at average speed through that corner.
		We find top speed by taking max on straights. straights are not corners

which tracks does car 1 perform good on.
	example: if car 1 is good at top speed, does it win on speed tracks such as monza

how does weather influence the car telemetrics and so on.
